This gem allows easy and dry handling of requests based on the dry-validation
gem for validation and data coersion. It allows to handle headers, filters,
include_options, sorting and of course to validate the body.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'request_handler'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install request_handler

## Configuration

You have to chose a validation engine and configure it globally:
```ruby
RequestHandler.configure do |config|
  config.validation_engine = RequestHandler::Validation::DryEngine
end
```

If you want to use the included dry engine you also have to add the dry gems to
your Gemfile:
```ruby
  gem 'dry-validation', '~> 1.0'
  gem 'dry-types', '~> 1.0'
```
Note that only dry >= 1.0 is supported.

The default logger and separator can be changed globally:

```ruby
RequestHandler.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Logger.new(STDERR)
  config.separator = '____'
end
```

JSON:API-style error data can be included in validation errors raised by `RequestHandler`.

```ruby
RequestHandler.configure do |config|
  config.raise_jsonapi_errors = true # default: false
end
```


### Validation Engine
You have to chose a validation engine and configure it globally (see
configuration section above).
All examples in this Readme assume you are using the `DryEngine` which relies on
dry-validation. However you can also use the builtin `DefinitionEngine`, which
uses [Definition](https://github.com/Goltergaul/definition) as validation
library:

```ruby
RequestHandler.configure do |config|
  require 'request_handler/validation/definition_engine'
  config.validation_engine = RequestHandler::Validation::DefinitionEngine
end
```

You can also implement your own engine to use any other library, by implementing
the abstract class `RequestHandler::Validation::Engine`

## Usage

To set up a handler, you need create a class which inherits from
`RequestHandler::Base`, providing at least the options block and a `to_dto`
method with the parts you want to use. To use it, create a new instance of the
handler passing in the request, after that you can use the handler.to_dto method to
process and access the data. Here is a short example, check
`spec/integration/request_handler_spec.rb` for a detailed one.

Please note that pagination only considers options that are configured on the
server (at least an empty configuration block int the page block), other options
sent by the client are ignored and will cause a warning.

Generic query params can be added by using the `query` block. This may be useful
if parameters should be validated which cannot be assigned to other predefined
option blocks.

A `type` param can be passed in the `body` block, or the `resource` block in
[multipart requests](#multipart-requests) (like `question` in the example below).
You can pass either a symbol or a string.
At the moment there are only "jsonapi" and "json" available for `type`. This
defines if the JsonApiDocumentParser or JsonParser is used.
If nothing is defined, JsonApiDocumentParser will be used by default.

```ruby
require "request_handler"
class DemoHandler < RequestHandler::Base
  options do
    page do
      default_size 10
      max_size 20
      resource :comments do
        default_size 20
        max_size 100
      end
    end

    include_options do
      allowed Dry::Types["strict.string"].enum("comments", "author")
    end

    sort_options do
      allowed Dry::Types["strict.string"].enum("age", "name")
    end

    filter do
      schema(
        Class.new(Dry::Validation::Contract) do
          option :foo
          params do
            required(:name).filled(:string)
          end
        end
      )
      additional_url_filter %i(user_id id)
      options(->(_handler, _request) { { foo: "bar" } })
      # options({foo: "bar"}) # also works for hash options instead of procs
    end

    query do
      schema(
        Dry::Schema.Params do
          optional(:name).filled(:string)
        end
      )
    end

    body do
      type :jsonapi
      schema(
        Class.new(Dry::Validation::Contract) do
          option :foo
          json do
            required(:id).filled(:string)
          end
        end
      )
      options(->(_handler, _request) { { foo: "bar" } })
      # options({foo: "bar"}) # also works for hash options instead of procs
    end
  end

  def to_dto
    OpenStruct.new(
      body:    body_params,
      page:    page_params,
      include: include_params,
      filter:  filter_params,
      sort:    sort_params,
      headers: headers
    )
  end
end

# Given a Rack::Request you can create a well defined dto through the request handler:
DemoHandler.new(request: request).to_dto
```
### Nested Attributes

For nested attributes all options or parameter will be flattened and nesting
will be represented by joining the nesting levels with the defined separator
string. By default this will be double underscore `__`.

This means in the request handler options one must use the attributes as flat
structure with the configured separator.

#### Example

Input query parameters like the following:

```http
GET /users?filter[name]=John&filter[posts.tag]=health
```

will be parsed as

```ruby
{
  name: "John",
  posts__tag: "health"
}
```

Same is applied for sort and include options.

```http
GET /users?sort=posts.published_on&include=posts.comments
```

becomes

```ruby
include_options = [:posts__comments]
sort_options = SortOption.new(:posts__published_on, :asc)
```

### Multipart requests
It is also possible to process and validate multipart requests, consisting of an arbitrary number of parts.
You can require specific resources, all the other listed resources are optional

The following request handler requires a question (which will be uploaded as a json-file) and accepts an additional
file related to the question

```ruby
class CreateQuestionHandler < RequestHandler::Base
  options do
    multipart do
      resource :question do
        required true
        type "json"
        schema(
          Dry::Schema.JSON do
            required(:id).filled(:string)
            required(:type).filled(:string)
            required(:content).filled(:string)
          end
        )
      end

      resource :file do
        # no validation necessary
      end
    end
  end

  def to_dto
    # see the resulting multipart_params below
    { multipart: multipart_params }
  end
end
```

Assuming that the request consists of a json file `question.json` containing
``` json
{
  "id": "1",
  "type": "questions",
  "content": "How much is the fish?"
}
```

and an additional file `image.png`, the resulting `multipart_params` will be the following:

``` ruby
{
  question:
    {
      id:      '1',
      type:    'questions',
      content: 'How much is the fish?'
    },
  file:
    {
      filename: 'image.png',
      type:     'application/octet-stream'
      name:     'file',
      tempfile: #<Tempfile:/...>,
      head:     'Content-Disposition: form-data;...'
    }
}
```

Please note that each part's content has to be uploaded as a separate file currently.

### JSON:API errors

Errors caused by bad requests respond to `:errors`.

When the gem is configured to `raise_jsonapi_errors`, this method returns a list of hashes
containing `code`, `status`, `detail`, (`links`) and `source` for each specific issue
that contributed to the error. Otherwise it returns an empty array.

The exception message contains `<error code>: <source> <detail>` for every issue,
with one issue per line.

| `:code`                   | `:status` | What is it? |
|:--------------------------|:----------|:------------|
| INVALID_RESOURCE_SCHEMA   | 422       | Resource did not pass configured validation |
| INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER   | 400       | Query parameter violates syntax or did not pass configured validation |
| MISSING_QUERY_PARAMETER   | 400       | Query parameter required in configuration is missing |
| INVALID_JSON_API          | 400       | Request body violates JSON:API syntax |
| INVALID_MULTIPART_REQUEST | 400       | Sidecar resource missing or invalid JSON |

#### Example
```ruby
rescue RequestHandler::SchemaValidationError => e
  puts e.errors
end
```

```ruby
[
  {
    status: '422',
    code: 'INVALID_RESOURCE_SCHEMA',
    title: 'Invalid resource',
    detail: 'is missing',
    source: { pointer: '/data/attributes/name' }
  }
]
```

### Caveats

It is currently expected that _url_ parameter are already parsed and included in
the request params. With Sinatra requests the following is needed to accomplish
this:

```ruby
get "/users/:user_id/posts" do
  request.params.merge!(params)
  dto = DemoHandler.new(request: request).to_dto
  # more code
end
```

## v1 to v2 migration guide
Multiple breaking changes were introduced with request_handler 2.0. This section
describes which steps have to be taken in order to migrate from 1.x to 2.0.

### Configure validation engine
By default the DryEngine was used in 1.0. You now have to explicitly configure
a validation engine:

```ruby
RequestHandler.configure do |config|
  config.validation_engine = RequestHandler::Validation::DryEngine
end
```

### Add dry dependency if you use the DryEngine
Since the DryEngine is not configured by default anymore, the dependency to the
dry gems could be removed from request_handler. If you use the DryEngine
simply add the dry-gems to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dry-validation', '~> 1.0'
gem 'dry-types', '~> 1.0'
```
Note that only dry >= 1.0 is supported.

### Define custom resources via the `resource` key
In request_handler 1.x it was possible to define custom resource names like this:

```ruby
options  do
  fieldsets do
    allowed do
      posts schema
    end
  end
end
```

This was possible in multiple places (`page`, `multipart`, `fieldsets.allowed`).
Starting with version 2.0 you will have to define those custom resources via the
`resource` key:

```ruby
options do
  fieldsets do
    allowed do
      resource :posts, schema
    end
  end
end
```

### Use dry-* 1.x instead of dry-* 0.x if you use the DryEngine
Some of the most common required changes are listed here:

* Use `Dry::Schema.Params` instead of `Dry::Validation.Schema`
* Use `Dry::Schema.JSON` instead of `Dry::Validation.JSON`
* If you use some more complex validation rules with options like this:

```
Dry::Validation.Params do
  configure do
    option :query_id
  end
  required(:id).value(eql?: query_id)
end

options(->(_parser, request) { { query_id: request.params['id'] } })
```

please rewrite it using `Dry::Validation::Contract` like this:

```
Class.new(Dry::Validation::Contract) do
  option :query_id
  params do
    required(:id).value(:string)
  end
  rule(:id) do
    key.failure('invalid id') unless values[:id] == query_id
  end
end)
options(->(_parser, request) { { query_id: request.params['id'] } })
```

A useful guide for upgrading to dry 1 types, validations and schemas can be
found [here](https://www.morozov.is/2019/05/31/upgrading-dry-gems.html).

Also please refer to the official docs of
[dry-schema](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-schema) and
[dry-validation](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-validation).

### Remove config inheritance
It was possible to (partially) overwrite configs defined in a request-handler
super-class:
```
class Parent < RequestHandler::Base
  options  do
    page do
      comments do
        default_size 20
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
class Child < Parent
  options  do
    page do
      comments do
        default_size 10
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Support for this has been fully removed. If you overwrite configs in subclasses
please remove the inheritance and define the two request-handlers separately.

## Development
